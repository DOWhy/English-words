词语辨析
purpose aim intention plan point idea
These are all words for talking about what sb/sth intends to do or achieve. 以上各词均指意图、目的、目标。

purpose

what sth is supposed to achieve; what sb is trying to achieve 指目的、目标：

Our campaign's main purpose is to raise money.

我们这次活动的主要目的是募款。

aim

what sb is trying to achieve; what sth is supposed to achieve 指目标、目的：

Our main aim is to increase sales in Europe.

我们的主要目标是增加在欧洲的销售量。

用purpose还是aim？
Your purpose for doing something is your reason for doing it; your aim is what you want to achieve. Aim can suggest that you are only trying to achieve sth; purpose gives a stronger sense of achievement being certain. Aim can be sb's aim or the aim of sth . Purpose is more usually the purpose of sth : you can talk about sb's purpose but that is more formal.

purpose指做某事的原因，aim指要达到的目的。

aim可以指尝试达到目的，purpose含有要成就某事的强烈感觉。

aim可指某人的目的（sb's aim），也可指某事的目的（the aim of sth），purpose更常指做某事的原因（the purpose of sth），也可指某人的目的（sb's purpose），但这样用较正式。

intention

what you intend to do 指打算、计划、意图：

I have no intention of going to the wedding.

我无意去参加婚礼。

She's full of good intentions but they rarely work out.

她虽然处处出于善意，却很少产生效果。

plan

what you intend to do or achieve 指计划、打算：

There are no plans to build new offices.

现在没有建新办公楼的计划。

用intention还是plan？
Your intentions are what you want to do, especially in the near future; your plans are what you have decided or arranged to do, often, but not always, in the longer term.

intention尤指近期的打算、意图；plan通常但不总是指较长远的计划、安排。

point

( rather informal ) the purpose or aim of sth 指意图、目的、理由：

What's the point of all this violence?

这些暴行的意图何在？

The point of the lesson is to compare the two countries.

本课的目的是比较这两个国家。

idea

( rather informal ) the purpose of sth; sb's aim 指目的、意图：

The whole idea of going was so that we could meet her new boyfriend.

我们去的唯一目的就是要见她的新男朋友。

What's the idea behind this?

这背后的意图是什么？

用point还是idea？
Point is a more negative word than idea. If you say What's the point…? you are suggesting that there is no point; if you say What's the idea…? you are genuinely asking a question. Point , but not idea , is used to talk about things you feel annoyed or unhappy about.

point比idea有更多的否定含义：what's the point ...?暗指毫无意义；what's the idea ...?用于真正询问目的。

用point而非idea表示对所谈论的事情感到不快：

There's no idea in…

I don't see the idea of…

常用搭配
with the purpose / aim / intention / idea of doing sth

sb's intention / plan to do sth

a(n) ambitious / realistic aim / plan

to have a(n) purpose / aim / intention / plan / point

to achieve / fulfil a(n) purpose / aim
